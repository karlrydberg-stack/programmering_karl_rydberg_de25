    "a) What is a sequence in Python? Give examples of sequence types.\n",
    "Collection of items, like lists and tuples, which elements can be called on by reffering to their placement or index number.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) What is the difference between a list and a tuple?\n",
    "Lists are changable after their creation whicle tuples are not. Furthermore, lists are created using \"[]\" while tuples are created with \"()\". Since tuples are immutable, it means they generally take up less memory space in comparison to lists, making them better in cases where the sequence is not expected to be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) How does indexing work in Python sequences? What happens if you use a negative index?\n",
    "Indexing, in relationship to sequences, have to do with how specific elements in a list for example, are called during runtime. The actual syntax consist of the variable name of the sequence, along with a \"[]\" where you specify the element. If a negative index is called Python will count the elements from the end of the list to the beginning, starting with -1. \n",
    "\n",
    "d) How does Python handle out-of-range indices in slicing vs indexing?\n",
    "In slicing, if you have referred to elements that do not exist, you will not get an error. If you have specified an existing index as a startpoint and an element that does not exist as an endpoint, Python will simply print the elements that do exist from the starpoint to the end of the list, without rasing an error. In indexing, if you refer to an index that does not exist you will get an IndexError.\n",
    "\n",
    "e) Which of the following sequence types are mutable: list, tuple, str, range?\n",
    "Lists and strings are mutable after their creation while tuples and range objects are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "f) What is sequence unpacking? Provide an example.\n",
    "Sequence unpacking is used to assign elements in a list to new, individual variables. If, for example, you have a list called \"todays_date\" with elements repesenting year, month and day, you can declare multiple variables, like \"year_variable\", \"month_variable\" and \"day_variable\" and assign each to the corresponding list item, all on the same line.\n",
    "Example: year_variable, month_variable, day_variable = todays_date \n",
    "\n",
    "g) What are some common use cases for enumerate() and zip() when working with sequences?\n",
    "enumerate() is a function used to append each element in a sequence with its corresponding index number, starting from 0. It can be used when you want to format an output in a certain way, where you want to be able to find an elements index position quickly for example. zip() is a function used to append elements with the same index number from two or more sequences to each other. If you have multiple lists with interconnected values, then zip() can be a good way of formatting the iterational output, so we can see which value from one list corresponds with a value from another list at the same position. \n",
    "\n",
    "h) What is the difference between sorted() and .sort() in lists?\n",
    ".sort() is a function that is only made for lists and returns the same list with the elements in order of the alphabet or number size. sorted() works in a similar way but accepts any iterable and does not return a modified sequence type but rather a new one."
